# Home - Practical CTF

* Contains lots of easy copy-paste commands/scripts to quickly do things
* My aim is to explain as much as possible how or why the attack works
* Inspired by [HackTricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/welcome/readme) but in my own style, and including all the challenges I've done

{% hint style="warning" %}
As you might see in the giant list of TODOs, this book is nowhere near done yet. So just keep in mind that it's still missing a lot
{% endhint %}

## Motivation

I make a lot of writeups on my blog where I explain how I solved a certain fun challenge. This is often to explain to others, but also partly to look back on if I remember _that_ I have done something, but not exactly _how_.&#x20;

My blog where I post CTF writeups, and general Hacking-related things
{% endembed %}

This book aims to be a big encyclopedia of everything I know about hacking. That way I can always look back at this book if I have done something before, without having the need for a challenge with a writeup.&#x20;
