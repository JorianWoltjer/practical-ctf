# Home - Practical CTF

:clipboard:  Contains lots of copy-paste-ready commands/scripts to get things done quickly

:brain:  I aim to explain as much as possible how and why the attack works

:man\_technologist:  Inspired by [HackTricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/welcome/readme) but in my style, and including all the experiences I've had

{% hint style="warning" %}
This book probably won't ever be 'done' as I will keep updating it as I learn stuff. You can check out the [GitHub ](https://github.com/JorianWoltjer/practical-ctf)repository to see every change that happens!
{% endhint %}

## Motivation

I make a lot of writeups on my blog where I explain how I solved a specific fun challenge. This is often to explain to others, but also partly to look back on if I remember _that_ I have done something, but not exactly _how_.&#x20;

My blog where I post CTF writeups, and general Hacking-related things
{% endembed %}

This book aims to be a big encyclopedia of everything I know about hacking. That way I can always look back at this book if I have done something before, without needing a full challenge with a writeup.&#x20;
