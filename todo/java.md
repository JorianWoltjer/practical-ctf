## Description

Java is an Object-Oriented programming language that compiles into Java bytecode. The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) understands this bytecode and can run it. You code it in `.java` files and then there are a few more file types that the compiler goes through:

* `.java` files are Java Source Code
* `.class` files are the compiled bytecode
* `.jar` files are a package of `.class` files (like a ZIP)
* JVM unpacks `.jar` and runs `.class` bytecode
